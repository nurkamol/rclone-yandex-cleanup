## üéØ Purpose

This script helps maintain a clean and organized backup storage by:
- Automatically removing old WordPress backup files
- Keeping only the most recent N backups per website
- Preventing storage overflow on Yandex Disk
- Supporting multiple WordPress sites in a single backup directory

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smart Retention Policy**: Keeps only the last 10 backups (configurable) for each website
- **Multi-Site Support**: Manages backups for multiple WordPress sites automatically
- **Safe Operation**: Includes DRY RUN mode for testing before actual deletion
- **File Locking**: Prevents multiple instances from running simultaneously
- **Selective Cleanup**: Only targets `.wpress` files, preserving other file types
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive output with color-coded status messages
- **Cron-Ready**: Designed for automated scheduling via crontab

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Linux/Unix System** (Tested on Debian 12)
- **Bash** 5.0 or higher
- **rclone** configured with Yandex Disk remote
- **Python3** (optional, for enhanced size reporting)
- Active Yandex Disk account with configured rclone remote

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nurkamol/rclone-yandex-cleanup.git
cd rclone-yandex-cleanup
```

2. **Make the script executable**:
```bash
chmod +x rclone-yandex-cleanup.sh
```

3. **Configure rclone** (if not already done):
```bash
rclone config
# Follow prompts to add Yandex Disk remote
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the script to match your setup:

```bash
# Configuration section at the top of the script
REMOTE_NAME="yandex-disk"          # Your rclone remote name
REMOTE_PATH="Backups"               # Remote folder path on Yandex Disk
LOCAL_BACKUP_PATH="/home/user/backup/"  # Local backup directory
KEEP_FILES=10                       # Number of backups to keep per site
TARGET_EXTENSION="wpress"           # File extension to manage
DRY_RUN=true                       # Set to false for actual deletion
```

## üìÅ Expected Directory Structure

```
Yandex Disk:
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Backups/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example.com/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example-com-20250814-163551-xxxxx.wpress
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example-com-20250807-163521-xxxxx.wpress
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ another-site.com/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ another-site-com-20250814-xxxxxx.wpress
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## üéÆ Usage

### Manual Execution

**Test with DRY RUN mode** (default):
```bash
./rclone-yandex-cleanup.sh
```

**Execute actual cleanup**:
```bash
# Edit script and set DRY_RUN=false, then run:
./rclone-yandex-cleanup.sh
```

### Automated Execution (Cron)

Add to crontab for automated cleanup:

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Run weekly on Sundays at 2 AM
0 2 * * 0 /path/to/rclone-yandex-cleanup.sh >> /var/log/rclone-yandex-cleanup.log 2>&1

# Or run daily at 3 AM
0 3 * * * /path/to/rclone-yandex-cleanup.sh >> /var/log/rclone-yandex-cleanup.log 2>&1
```

## üìä Script Workflow

1. **Lock Acquisition**: Prevents multiple instances from running
2. **Backup Upload**: Syncs local backups to Yandex Disk
3. **Directory Scanning**: Identifies all website folders
4. **File Analysis**: For each website:
   - Lists all `.wpress` files
   - Sorts by modification time (newest first)
   - Identifies files to keep and delete
5. **Cleanup Execution**: Removes old backups (if not in DRY RUN mode)
6. **Summary Report**: Displays statistics and disk usage
7. **Lock Release**: Allows future runs

## üîí Safety Features

- **DRY RUN Mode**: Test what would be deleted without actual removal
- **File Type Protection**: Only processes `.wpress` files
- **Lock File**: Prevents concurrent execution
- **Atomic Operations**: Each file deletion is independent
- **Verification**: Double-checks file extensions before deletion

## üìù Log Management

### Basic Logging
```bash
# Redirect output to log file
./rclone-yandex-cleanup.sh >> /var/log/rclone-yandex-cleanup.log 2>&1
```

### Log Rotation Setup
Create `/etc/logrotate.d/rclone-yandex-cleanup`:
```
/var/log/rclone-yandex-cleanup.log {
    weekly
    rotate 4
    compress
    missingok
    notifempty
    create 0644 root root
}
```

## üîç Example Output

```
rclone-yandex-cleanup v1.0.0
Yandex Disk Backup Management System
================================================
üîç DRY RUN MODE - No files will be deleted
Target: .wpress files only

Processing: example.com
  Found 15 .wpress file(s)
  Will delete 5 old .wpress backup(s)...
  Keeping these files:
    ‚úì example-com-20250814-backup.wpress
    ‚úì example-com-20250807-backup.wpress
    ... (8 more recent files)
  Files to delete:
    √ó example-com-20250501-backup.wpress ... [DRY RUN - Would DELETE]
    √ó example-com-20250424-backup.wpress ... [DRY RUN - Would DELETE]
    ... (3 more old files)

Summary: 934 files, 698.41 GB total
```

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### Bandwidth Limiting
To limit bandwidth usage, add to rclone commands:
```bash
rclone copy ... --bwlimit 10M  # Limit to 10 MB/s
```

### Low Priority Execution
Run with nice for lower system priority:
```bash
nice -n 10 ./rclone-yandex-cleanup.sh
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Another instance is already running"**
   - Check for stuck lock file: `rm /var/lock/rclone-yandex-cleanup.lock`

2. **"directory not found" errors**
   - Verify rclone remote configuration: `rclone lsd yandex-disk:`
   - Check remote path exists: `rclone lsd yandex-disk:Backups`

3. **No files being processed**
   - Verify file extension setting matches your backup files
   - Check directory structure on Yandex Disk

4. **Permission denied**
   - Ensure script has execute permissions: `chmod +x rclone-yandex-cleanup.sh`
   - Check write permissions for log directory

## üìã System Requirements

- **OS**: Linux/Unix (Tested on Debian 12)
- **Shell**: Bash 5.0+
- **Dependencies**: 
  - rclone (required)
  - python3 (optional, for size calculations)
  - Standard Unix utilities: awk, sed, sort, head, tail, wc
